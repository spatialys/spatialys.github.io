<img src="/img/even.png" alt="Even Rouault" align="left" style="padding:15px"/>
I am a C/C++ (as well as Java and Python) software developer, based in France, with strong expertise on the
<a href="http://gdal.org/"><img src="/img/gdalicon.png" alt="GDAL logo"/>GDAL/OGR</a> software,
primarly developed by Frank Warmerdam and now governed by a Project Steering Committee
under the <a href="http://osgeo.org">Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)</a>.
I have been involved in the development of the project since 2007,
being member of its PSC from 2008 until now, to the point of being its main maintener.
</p>
I am also a committer of <a href="http://mapserver.org">MapServer</a>,
<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">PROJ.4</a> and
<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/">libgeotiff</a>, and also involved
in the developement of
<a href="http://shapelib.maptools.org/">shapelib</a> and
<a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/">libtiff</a>
</p>
<p>
I have been elected as an OSGeo Charter Member in 2011.
</p>
<p>
After many years of heavy involvment in GDAL and MapServer in parallel to other
activities, I've decided to found Spatialys, to be able to dedicate my full time
to bring my expertise around those technologies at your service.
